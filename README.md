# EchoSign

**EchoSign** is a Flutter-based mobile camera application designed to detect sign language gestures and translate them into text and voice. The app utilizes machine learning, with a model trained on American Sign Language (ASL) gestures, to help bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired community.

## Model and Server Setup

1. **Download the Model**:
   Download the trained InceptionV3 model from [this link](https://github.com/Muhammad-Ali-Khokhar/EchoSign/blob/master/other_resources/InceptionV3_Model.tflite).

2. **Set Up the Server**:
   - Download the `server_code.py` file from [this link](https://github.com/Muhammad-Ali-Khokhar/EchoSign/blob/master/other_resources/server_code.py).
   - Update the model path in the `server_code.py` to match the location of your downloaded model.
   - Start the server using CMD:
     ```bash
     python server_code.py
     ```
   Ensure that your laptop and mobile device are on the same network so the app can communicate with the server.

## Usage

2. **Main Camera Screen**:
   - Toggle settings as needed.
   - Press the recording button to capture gestures.
   - Wait for the prediction to be displayed and spoken.
3. **Server**: Ensure your server is running before attempting to use the gesture recognition feature.
